## Reflections for the year 2023

> “There are better things ahead than any we leave behind." — C.S. Lewis

This past year has been a wild ride. Or thats typically how anything feels like after you've done it than what you have been starting with.

In terms of technical terms, to be honest, I've not done much. Now that I reflect back, i have been busy with college mostly and have not done much on self learning and development.

Honestly I was finding it hard to keep up with more things at once. As the year goes by, new semesters, new subjects and things start to pile up. As much as I want to make something or learn something, I cannot keep up with that due to some poor time management on my part. On the other side, I see some people doing it all and sometimes I get overwhelmed and just... sleep _to let it all be forgotten_.

Well, things wont fix themselves if I _continue_ like this. In the recent fall semester, I found myself a bit more distracted and not doing due diligence to my academics as before. I managed to pull off the semester unharmed (I think), but I would rather not do it this way again.

Apart from the technicalities and academics, life in general has been okay. I do need to make the efforts to get fit. Currently, I think I'll be focusing on a few things more:

- Studies
- Working out and focusing on health
- Some interview style prep and possilbly
- Looking out for some internships in the coming year

The thing with internships is I need to look for _where to look for them_.

Apart from the former things, let's see about how the tech scene is evolving. And what I want to try out. Some of the things which I have been dabbling with NextJS with their <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn" data-link>new docs</a>. I'm liking it so far, the docs are great and I learnt some things in general as well from it. I want to make more projects in it and projects in general. More fullstack. Idea: Maybe I'll write a blog post to see the challenges I've faced and solutions and my thoughts. I've not written any backend stuff in like months and feel like I'm very out of touch. Authentication with OAuth providers would be good to know.

An actual idea to learn is to make a social media app or something. That will touch upon all parts maybe i think. A better way to learn the ins and outs of any framework. I used React `<Suspense>` for skeletons while loading and it felt for a more succint and nice user experience.

With some of the core CS subjects coming up like DBMS, OOPs, OS and stuff, I would like to put those in practice as well. Because you can go so far with theory you know.

I think thats some of the aspirations and reflections. Be better than what you were yesterday basically. In the long run, that's what I think will work out. And dont be afraid to learn or collect suggestions! Sometimes you aren't always the wise and everyone needs a bit of help.

Wishing you a Happy New Year 2024! **Adieu!**
